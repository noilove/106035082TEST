## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())

ifelse(!require(quantmod),install.packages('quantmod'),library(quantmod))
tw20_adj_close<-read.csv("2018Q4_20.csv")

ifelse(!require(readr),install.packages('read'),library(readr))
tw20.text<-read.table("tw20.txt")

ifelse(!require(reshape2),install.packages('reshape2'),library(reshape2))
colnames(tw20.txt)<-c("id","","date","price")
tw20.xts=dcast(tw20.txt,date~id)
```
